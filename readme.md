#[Fieldnotes](https://github.com/digitalvapor/fieldnotes)

How to embed your day of adventure and geotagging, then write a post in markdown, and use the code with an iPython notebook.

* See [redwood-regional]() for a post that uses just an iPython notebook (two iNat users).
* See [sutro-forest]() for a post that uses just a Pelican Plugin (two iNat users).
* See [muir]() for a post that uses both (single iNat user).
* See [jv-fitzgerald]() for another combo post (single iNat user).

##To-do
* Everything, **this is a work in progress**.

#Instructions
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/digitalvapor/fieldnotes.git`

For just the iPython Notebook portion, you can run `ipython notebook` in any folder that contains the notebooks.

For the whole website, that utilizes the static site generator Pelican, run `pelican && firefox output/index.html`.
